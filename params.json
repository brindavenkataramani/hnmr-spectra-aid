The source code is also provided if you want to play around with it. To draw a peak, click and hold at the position the peak should be placed and press either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, for peak splitting, where 1 corresponds to a singlet, 2 to a doublet, etc. Peak splitting beyond quintets is not supported, as they are uncommon, and would take away from the general graphical fluidity of the application.\r\n\r\nTo enter analytical mode, after you've drawn the spectrum, simply hit the space bar, and mouse over the region of interest to determine the functional group associated with a particular chemical shift.\r\n\r\nIntended audience is students studying organic chemistry; teachers looking to make practice problems. In no way is this an in-depth substitute for professional HNMR analysis -- simply a free lightweight, alternative to the costly and bulky tools in existence.\r\n\r\nGet the ready to roll app here, https://github.com/brinda-venkataramani/hnmr-spectra-aid/releases/tag/v0.5-alpha, or view the source code!\r\n\r\n### Legal Things\r\nThis software is open source and free for all to use and distribute. The source code is available and freely editable to suit individual user needs. It would be nice if this project was sourced back to its source however. But again -- that's optional.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
